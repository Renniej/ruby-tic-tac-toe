# Business logic
# Enter player 1's name
# Enter player 2's name
#
# While the game is not a tie or has a winner
#   ask the next player where they would like to place their symbol
#     if the that cell is already full, inform the player and ask them to choose again.
#   after the move check for these win conditions
#       left diagonal
#       right diagonal
#       horizontal
#       vertical
#   if a win or tie condition exist then exit the game
#   output winner or if it was a tie
